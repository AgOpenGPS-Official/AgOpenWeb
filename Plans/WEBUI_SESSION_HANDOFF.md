# Web-UI Migration — Session Handoff (continuation prompt)

Paste the section below to continue the AgValoniaGPS web-UI migration in a fresh session.

---

**Continue the AgValoniaGPS web-UI migration.**

## Repo / branch
- Repo: `/Users/chris/Code/AgValoniaGPS3` (Avalonia/.NET 10 agricultural GPS app).
- Branch: `feature/web-ui-phase2` (off **develop** — PRs target develop, NOT master).
  Stays unmerged until field-validated; commit + push to it as we go. **develop has been
  merged in** (the §13/§14 config/state apply-gap fixes — `SectionState` class was deleted
  upstream; `SceneProjector` reads `ISectionControlService` + `ToolConfig.MaxSections`).
- Working tree clean. **Current version `26.5.64`** (we DO bump `sys/version.h` per commit now).

## What this is
Replacing the native in-cab Avalonia UI with a browser client served by an embedded
ASP.NET Core server (`Shared/AgValoniaGPS.RemoteServer`) that runs alongside the app.
Browse to `http://<host>:5174`. The **host stays the brain** (Avalonia-free
`ApplicationState` + services + `MainViewModel`); the browser is a thin client that
receives projected *state* over a binary WebSocket and sends *command ids* back through a
safe allowlist. Migration = project more state + accept more command ids + build HTML/JS.
**Do NOT port logic into JS.** End state: headless host, browser is the only UI.

- **Full plan:** `Plans/WEBUI_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` (phase list, safety/control model, cutover).
- **Seam files:** `RemoteServer/{Contracts.cs, WireCodec.cs, SceneProjector.cs,
  CoverageProjector.cs, MapBroadcaster.cs, WebSocketHub.cs, ControlAuthority.cs,
  RemoteServerHost.cs}`; client `wwwroot/{app.js, transport.js, index.html}`; command map +
  safety wiring + host-side projectors/handlers in `Platforms/AgValoniaGPS.Desktop/App.axaml.cs`.

## Done & pushed
- **Session 2026-06-17 additions (left nav now 6/8 buttons):**
  - **Network IO + NTRIP** (`0ee454d7`, v26.5.59) — module checkboxes/status/IP, Scan (PGN 202),
    subnet change (PGN 201, gated), Host IPs, NTRIP status + Profiles/Editor dialogs. Wire frame
    **NtripProfiles=11**; shared `NtripConnectionTester`.
  - **Unified non-modal nav model** (`86ac6e6d`, v26.5.60) — dimming modals eliminated;
    transparent light-dismiss scrim; watch-tractor panels opt out; see `[[project_unified_nav_model]]`.
  - **Field Operations** (`d8299d26`/`fbc9556b`/`b71796e2`, v26.5.61–63) — Fields-and-Jobs lifecycle +
    New Field/From Existing/ISO-XML/KML + cross-field Resume Job + AgShare Upload/Download/Settings.
    Wire frames **FieldOps=12, AgShare=13**; host `AgShareRemote.cs` + `EnsureRemoteStartWorkSession`.
  - **File / Application Menu** (`79697583`, v26.5.64) — App Settings (units/kbd/fs/elev moved out of
    Screen & Alerts + App Directories), Language, Reset All, View All Settings (near-fullscreen),
    Log Viewer, Hotkeys, Help, About, Bug Report. Wire frame **AppInfo=14**; sim show/hide persists
    via `PersistentAppState.SimulatorPanelVisible` (Status `simPanelVisible` + `sim.togglePanel`).
  - **NEXT: 2 buttons remain — Tools, Field Tools** (see the inventory table below).
- **Phases 1–8** (status bar, control-authority safety layer, right-nav toolbar, lower-right
  cluster + Skia-only renderer, GPS-detail card, simulator panel + dialog host, section bar,
  bottom nav/field tools) — see git history. CanvasKit is the SOLE renderer (`skFrame` loop).
- **Phase 9 (left nav: config/setup) — large, multi-commit, MOSTLY done:**
  - **9a** left-nav shell + config bridge (`config.set`, units).
  - **Vehicle & Tool config** — picker **hub** + full Vehicle dialog + full Tool dialog
    (all tabs, diagrams, per-section/zone/colour/24-pin editors). Built to FULL native depth.
  - **Screen & Alerts** — full panel; **+ button icons + "Next Boundary Dist" rename**
    (renamed from "Headland Dist" — the value is distance to whichever boundary is approached,
    outer when no headland; internal `HeadlandDistanceVisible` flag unchanged).
  - **Next-boundary distance HUD** — `#headland-hud` top-centre overlay; `HeadlandProximity-
    Distance`/`Warning` on the Tick from `FieldState`.
  - **AutoSteer config panel** (`5789a1e6`) — full native `AutoSteerConfigPanel`: title bar,
    left pane (4 horizontal icon tabs Pure-Pursuit/Sensor/Deadzone/Gain) + Set/Act/Err status
    bar with the **expand toggle**, expanded reveals **Test Mode** (free-drive) + a right pane
    (5 icon tabs) + Smart-WAS / Defaults / Send+Save / OK actions. `AutoSteerConfigDto` on the
    Config frame; steer telemetry on the Status frame; hardware-push actions route through the
    real `AutoSteerConfigViewModel` (gated `autosteer.*`).
  - **Smart-WAS dialog** (`1431a131`) — modal; live stats from `ISmartWasCalibrationService.
    GetSnapshot()` on the Status frame; Start/Stop/Reset/Apply through `SmartWasViewModel`.
  - **Steer Wizard** (`d10af123`) — **host-driven**: the real `SteerWizardViewModel` runs on
    the host; a **Wizard frame (wire type 10)** streams nav state + status bar + a calibration
    live-blob each tick while open; the browser forwards nav (`wizard.next/back/skip/finish/
    cancel`), hardware level (`wizard.hw`), and **gated** calibration actions
    (`wizard.action|<Cmd>`); editable values reuse `config.set`. Host glue in `App.axaml.cs`
    drives the VM by **generic reflection** (`SetWizardProp`/`InvokeWizardAction`/
    `BuildWizardDto`); `MapBroadcaster.WizardProvider`. All 15 steps render incl. a map-style
    roll gauge on Roll-Cal.
  - **Light Bar / Steer Bar / master rework** (`906ef7b6`) — studied AgOpen + Twol: one top
    bar, master (`GuidanceBarOn`, was dead) + mutually-exclusive mode (Light=cross-track,
    Steer=steer-angle **error** = actual WAS − commanded, dead-zone ±0.5/0.2°, ±12° scale).
    Fixed native `LightBarPanel`/`SkiaMapControl`/callers + web (SteerAngleError on Tick).

## ⚠ Test rig — VehicleSimulator (you need this to test the AutoSteer/calibration surface)
`Simulators/AgValoniaGPS.VehicleSimulator/` is a virtual AiO that speaks the **real UDP/PGN
protocol** (ports line up: sim→app 9999, app→sim 8888, loopback). It streams **PGN 253**
(live WAS angle/PWM, responds to PGN 254) + GPS motion. This is the ONLY way to exercise
Smart-WAS collection, the AutoSteer Test-Mode live angle / free-drive, the steer bar, and the
wizard calibration steps — the app's *internal* simulator does NOT emit steer data, so those
read 0 without it.
- Run: app with its **internal sim OFF**, then `dotnet run --project
  Simulators/AgValoniaGPS.VehicleSimulator/AgValoniaGPS.VehicleSimulator.csproj`, set
  **Speed > 2 km/h**, engage autosteer. (GPS source is exclusive — don't run both sims.)
- The sim got QoL this session: STOP/center(`>0<`)/zero + ±0.5 nudge buttons on Speed/Wheel/
  Roll; persisted GPS pose (`vehsim.json`) with **8-digit** coords + a **Save Position** button.

## Remaining Phase-9 sub-phases — FULL left-nav inventory (8 native buttons)
The native left nav (`LeftNavigationPanel.axaml`) has **8 buttons**. Web status:
| # | Native button | Web status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | File / Application Menu | ✅ built (`#filemenu` + App Settings/Language/View All/Log Viewer/Hotkeys/Help/About/Bug Report) |
| 2 | Screen & Alerts | ✅ built (`#screenalerts`) |
| 3 | **Tools** | ❌ NOT BUILT |
| 4 | Vehicle / Tool Configuration | ✅ built (`#vehtoolhub`/`#vehiclecfg`/`#toolcfg`) |
| 5 | Field Operations | ✅ built (`#fieldops` + Fields-and-Jobs + creation + Resume Job + AgShare) |
| 6 | **Field Tools** | ❌ NOT BUILT — launcher items + **map-tap boundary work (needs Phase MT)** |
| 7 | AutoSteer Configuration | ✅ built (`#autosteercfg` + Smart-WAS + Wizard) |
| 8 | Network IO | ✅ built (`#networkio` + NTRIP) |

**2 of 8 buttons remain: Tools, Field Tools.** (File/App Menu done v26.5.64 — fly-out + App
Settings [units/kbd/fullscreen/elev migrated OUT of Screen & Alerts + App Directories] + Language
+ Reset All + View All Settings [read-only tree from the config frame] + Log Viewer [AppInfo logs,
level filter] + Hotkeys [list + click-to-capture] + Help [external links] + About + Bug Report.
Wire frame **AppInfo=14**; host write `app.*` + `AgShareRemote`-style bug-report dump.)
- **Field Operations** ✅ DONE (v26.5.61–63). Fly-out (Fields and Jobs / Resume Last / Resume Job /
  Drive In / Close + AgShare Upload/Download/API + status pill); Fields-and-Jobs chain panel; New
  Field / From Existing / From ISO-XML / From KML creation panels; cross-field Resume Job picker;
  AgShare Settings/Upload/Download. Wire frames **FieldOps=12**, **AgShare=13**. Host: lifecycle via
  host-driven `EnsureRemoteStartWorkSession`; creation via `RemoteCreateFrom*`; AgShare orchestration
  replicated host-side in Desktop `AgShareRemote.cs` (services aren't DI-registered) → writes
  `ApplicationState.AgShare`. Remaining pick:
- ~~**Network IO + NTRIP**~~ ✅ **DONE (v26.5.59, pending device test).** Full `NetworkIoPanel`
  parity: module present-checkbox + status dot + IP (GPS/AutoSteer/Machine/IMU), Scan for
  Modules (`net.scan`, PGN 202), global subnet change (`net.subnet`, PGN 201 — **Tier-2 gated**,
  client confirm), Host IPs readout, NTRIP status/bytes + a full **NTRIP Profiles** modal
  (add/edit/delete/set-default) + **Edit Profile** modal (host/port/mount/user/pass, Test
  Connection, field-association checkboxes, auto-connect, default). Read side: new Status-frame
  fields (GpsIp/ModuleSubnet/HostIps/Ntrip*) + new **NtripProfiles frame (wire type 11)**. Write
  side: `net.*` → `IUdpCommunicationService`; `ntrip.*` (save/delete/setDefault/test) →
  `INtripProfileService` directly (mirrors `ApplyProfileCommand`); Test Connection reuses the new
  shared `NtripConnectionTester` (also now used by the native VM — no duplicated TCP probe),
  result projected via `ConnectionState.NtripTestStatus`. SceneProjector gained
  `IUdpCommunicationService` + `INtripProfileService` (passed through `RemoteServerHost.StartAsync`
  → updated the Desktop call). Plan: `Plans/NETWORK_IO_PLAN.md` + memory `[[project_network_io_panel]]`.
- **File / Application Menu** (`Panels/FileMenuPanel.axaml`) — owns Application Settings:
  Language · Reset All Settings · **App Settings (modal)** · View All Settings · Log Viewer ·
  Hotkeys · Simulator · Help · About · Bug Report Dump. ⚠ A subset of App Settings (units /
  on-screen keyboard / start-fullscreen / elevation-log) currently lives **inside the web
  Screen & Alerts panel** with a "moves to its own dialog" note — building this means
  migrating those four OUT, per `[[project_screen_alerts_settings_ia]]` (non-modal Screen &
  Alerts vs modal App Settings).
- **Tools** (`Panels/ToolsPanel.axaml`) — Steer Wizard launcher (VM already web-wired) · Log
  Viewer · Roll Correction · Steer Chart · Heading Chart · XTE Chart (3 diagnostic charts, none
  built in web).
- **Field Operations** (`Panels/FieldOperationsPanel.axaml`) — field lifecycle: Fields and Jobs
  · Resume Last Job · Resume Job · Drive In · Close · AgShare Upload/Download/Settings. Needs a
  field-list read-frame + confirm dialogs (mostly command-driven).
- **Field Tools** (`Panels/FieldToolsPanel.axaml`) — Field Builder · Boundary · Delete Applied
  Area · Import Tracks · Recorded Path · Offset Fix. The launcher items are form/command panels,
  BUT **the boundary work and several others are map-tap features** (see the Map-Tap phase below) —
  Field Tools is NOT complete until those are built.

## Phase MT — Map-tap interaction (REQUIRED; the migration is NOT done until this ships)
The map-tap features need the operator to **tap a location on the map canvas** to act, unlike the
form/command panels. They ALL depend on one missing piece: **screen→world unprojection** — turn a
tap (x,y px) into a field coordinate (E,N). The renderer only does world→screen (`w2s`) today.
Build the inverse ONCE, reuse everywhere:
- Flat/top-down: invert pan/zoom/rotation. **3D tilt: invert the perspective M44 + ray-cast onto the
  ground plane** (the hard part — `perspM` is column-vector/row-major; see Renderer notes).
Features that need it (across Field Tools + bottom-nav + Tracks):
- **Boundary** — record/draw/edit field boundaries by tapping (the bulk of Field Tools).
- **Quick AB / Draw AB** — set an AB line by tapping A then B; draw curves by tapping points.
- **Place flag on map** — drop a flag at a tapped point (note: "place flag here" at the vehicle
  already works in the bottom-nav; only the arbitrary-point placement needs map-tap).
- **Flag list** — pick/locate/move flags on the map.
- **Tracks** — on-map point picking for track create/edit.
This is its own phase. Treat the web migration as INCOMPLETE until Phase MT is done.

Then **Phase 10** — mop-up + headless cutover (host goes UI-less; browser is the only UI).

## Navigation model — SINGLE UNIFIED MODEL (LOCKED 2026-06-17)
**There is ONE navigation model. Dimming modals are eliminated as a category.** Everything is
a chain panel; "only one panel on screen at a time." Decision rationale: the only thing a
dimming modal did that the chain didn't was *block* the map + persistent toolbars — and a
**transparent light-dismiss scrim** already gives that safety (the outside tap is *consumed* to
close the panel, so the background never receives it) **without** hiding the field. So the modal
adds nothing. Native already proves the mechanism — chain dialogs use *"a fully transparent
light-dismiss scrim (not a darkening backdrop)"* (`NtripProfilesDialogPanel.axaml`).

The model:
- **One panel visible at a time.** Opening a child REPLACES the parent (not stacked). Source of
  truth = `MainViewModel.Navigation.Chain.cs` (`OpenChainDialog`/`PushChainDialog`/`NavigateBack`/
  `CloseChain`). Web = `ln-panel` in `LN_NAV_PANELS`, opened via `lnOpen` (which `lnCloseAll`s first).
- **Header chrome:** fly-out / chain-root = **Title + ✕** (`FloatingPanel`); deeper chain panel =
  **← Back + Title + ✕** (`DialogChrome`). Back reopens the specific parent; ✕ closes the whole
  chain to the map. Web: plain closers tagged `.ln-closex` → `lnCloseAll`; chain Back/✕ get
  parent-aware handlers.
- **Transparent light-dismiss scrim** behind the open panel: map fully visible, outside-tap closes
  the chain and is **consumed** (does not actuate the background). This is the blocking-safety,
  minus the dimming.
- **Watch-the-tractor exception** (Smart-WAS, AutoSteer free-drive test, wizard cal steps): these
  need to pan/zoom the map to watch the tractor, so they **opt OUT of light-dismiss** — no scrim,
  map fully interactive, panel persists, closes only via the header. The only deliberate
  non-dismiss surface type.
- **Steer Wizard** stays full-screen — it's a guided multi-step flow with its own gauges, not a
  map view; "blocking" isn't the issue there.

**Migration to the locked model — DONE (v26.5.60, pending device test):**
1. ✅ **Transparent light-dismiss scrim** (`#ln-scrim`, z30): shown behind open chain panels by
   `lnOpen` (hidden for `NO_SCRIM` watch-tractor panels), tap closes the chain + is **consumed**
   (`stopPropagation` → no map pan). Removed the `lnCloseAll()` from the global window-pointerdown
   closer. Z-restack: scrim 30 / panels 31 / left-nav bar 32 (one-tap panel switching) / dialoghost 50.
2. ✅ **Shared confirm** (`showConfirm(title,msg,cb)` → `#dlg-confirm` card in the now-transparent
   dialog host): replaced all four browser `confirm()` calls (hub delete + reset, NTRIP delete,
   subnet change). Backdrop tap / Cancel = no action. (AutoSteer reset keeps its in-context
   `.as-confirm` inline bar — already non-modal; left as the nicer in-panel pattern.)
3. ✅ **Smart-WAS → watch-tractor chain panel** (`#smartwas`, `ln-panel`, in `NO_SCRIM`): map stays
   interactive, header-only close (← Back → AutoSteer, ✕ → map). **SimCoords** now uses the
   transparent dialog-host backdrop (light-dismiss, no dim).
NTRIP Profiles + Editor already were chain panels. Steer Wizard stays full-screen. **No dimming
modals remain** in the web client.
Open sub-detail (not blocking): a confirm currently shows a centered card with a transparent scrim
regardless of origin — fine since all current confirms originate inside a panel; revisit anchor if a
persistent-toolbar confirm is ever added.

**Native divergence:** native still uses dimming modals for Smart-WAS / confirmations. This unified
model is a **web-led improvement** (web is the end-state UI). Whether to backport to native is open.

## Established patterns (reuse these — they're the template now)
- **Config bridge (settings panels):** structured read-frame (a `*Dto` projection of
  `ConfigStore`) seeded on connect + re-sent on a **fingerprint** change (broadcaster);
  writes via `config.set|<section>.<field>:<value>` (indexed arrays `key:i,val`) handled in
  `ApplyConfigSet`. Generic client helpers: `wireCfgControls`/`populateCfgControls`/
  `wireTabStrip`/`fmtRo`; data attrs `data-key`/`data-show`/`data-active`/`data-fmt`;
  `.cfg-num`/`.cfg-tgl`/`.cfg-typebtn`/`.cfg-slider[data-fmt]`/`.cfg-isel`.
- **Host-driven dialogs/wizards:** route hardware/stateful actions through the REAL child VM
  (`AutoSteerConfigViewModel`/`SmartWasViewModel`/`SteerWizardViewModel`) via an
  `EnsureXxxViewModel()` on `MainViewModel` — never reimplement PGN/calibration logic in JS.
  The wizard adds a Wizard frame + reflection-driven `wizard.set`/`wizard.action` +
  `MapBroadcaster.WizardProvider`.
- **Icons:** the `/icons/{file}` endpoint serves **embedded** `RemoteServer/wwwroot/icons/*`.
  Native icons live in `Shared/AgValoniaGPS.Views/Assets/Icons[/Config]/` — **copy the PNGs
  in** before referencing them, else broken-link. Rebuild RemoteServer to embed.
- **Frame types:** Scene=1 Tick=2 CoverageInit=3 CoverageCells=4 Status=5 ControlState=6
  Hello=7 Config=8 Profiles=9 Wizard=10 NtripProfiles=11 FieldOps=12 AgShare=13 **AppInfo=14**.
- **Tier-2 gating** (`IsRestrictedCommand`, control-gated): prefixes `section.` `autosteer.`
  `youturn.` `contour.` `track.` `headland.` `smartwas.` `wizard.action`, plus the exact id
  `net.subnet` (restarts every module). Tier-1 (ungated): `sim.` `tool.` `map.` `flag.` `tram.`
  `display.` `config.set` (incl. `conn.*` module-present) `profile.*` `net.scan` `ntrip.*`
  `wizard.{open,next,back,skip,finish,cancel,hw,set}`. Client dims gated controls (`.rn-gated`/`.disabled`)
  off `iHoldControl`; the host re-gates.
- **Command-with-args:** host `CommandHandler` is `Action<string,string>` (id, arg); client
  sends `transport.send('id|arg')`. Arg-carrying ids handled in the `switch` above the ICommand
  map in `App.axaml.cs`.

## Projection / SoT pattern (the source of most bugs)
Runtime UI state often lives in the **VM as plain fields**, not `ApplicationState`. Recipe:
find where the VM holds it → if a live SoT exists in `ApplicationState` (`*State`, runtime) or
`ConfigStore` (`*Config`, persisted), **project that and make the VM a pass-through**; only
mirror into `ApplicationState` if there's no SoT. Watch for **same-named-but-different** fields
and **dead VM duplicates** (grep the CONSUMER before mirroring). See memory
`[[project_state_model_sot]]`. Config = `ConfigStore`; don't mirror dead VM config fields.
⚠ Some `Display.*` flags were dead on NATIVE too (config→renderer apply gap) — that was the
separate §13 audit work (now merged from develop), **not** the web migration.

## Workflow rules
- **Embedded assets:** `wwwroot/*` (incl. `icons/*`) are `EmbeddedResource` in RemoteServer.
  `dotnet build Platforms/AgValoniaGPS.Desktop/...` re-embeds changed files without nuking bin.
  After any `wwwroot` change the user must **restart** the app to load the new DLL (JS-only
  edits still need the rebuild+restart to re-embed; a pure browser reload only helps if the
  file is served from disk, which it is NOT — it's embedded). Verify embed with
  `strings .../AgValoniaGPS.RemoteServer.dll | grep <marker>` if unsure.
- **Can't meaningfully run the GUI** — user runs `dotnet run --project Platforms/
  AgValoniaGPS.Desktop/...` and reports. **Build to verify compile; wait for the user to
  confirm before committing. One commit + push per verified fix.** Bump `sys/version.h` each.
- **Match native by screenshot, not just AXAML** — this session the AutoSteer panel took 3
  passes because AXAML alone hid the tab orientation + the collapsed/expanded modes. Ask for
  screenshots of any non-trivial native panel before building it.
- `node --check wwwroot/app.js` catches syntax but NOT TDZ — watch `const` ordering.
- DI/ctor changes touch all 3 platforms; the RemoteServer is **Desktop-only** so far
  (`RemoteServerHost.StartAsync` is called only from Desktop `App.axaml.cs`).

## Renderer notes (CanvasKit, app.js)
- Skia-only. `skFrame()` single loop: `updateCamera()` → `renderSkia()` → DOM overlays
  (`renderStatusBar`/`renderRightNav`/`renderRoll`/`renderCampad`/`updateLightbarText`/
  `updateHeadlandHud`/`renderSettings`) → `updateHud()`.
- `w2s(e,n)`: perspective via `perspM` (M44, column-vector/row-major) when tilted, else 2D
  ortho+rotation. Vectors draw per-vertex via `w2s`; rasters + 3D grid draw in WORLD coords
  under `canvas.concat(perspM)`. Non-color-managed surface (sRGB blend like native).
  Camera modes 0=N 1=H 2=Free 3=Map; `strokePtsSk3D` near-plane-clips polylines.

**Remaining to finish the migration (all REQUIRED — there is no "later"): (1) Tools button,
(2) Field Tools button, (3) Phase MT — map-tap interaction (boundary/AB/flags/tracks), (4)
Phase 10 headless cutover. Build each sub-phased per the patterns above. Use the VehicleSimulator
rig to test anything touching steer/GPS/calibration. Ask for native screenshots before building a
new panel.**
